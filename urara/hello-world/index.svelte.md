## Chapter 1
### №1
In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 

吾年少气盛易伤之时，家严予以些许忠告，迄今念念不忘。

<br/>

"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, " he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had." 

曰：“欲责人，勿忘己之优渥，非众皆有。”

<br/>

He didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved say, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. 

其虽未多言，然心照不宣而神会，吾知其言简而意深。

<br/>

In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. 

鉴于此，三缄其口，不妄下论断。或有皎洁之人赤诚相待，亦致老谋之徒泛泛而叨。遇后者，苦不堪言。

<br/>

（呜呜呜明天要早起……先……就这样！明天补足！QAQ）

### №2

The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. 

若常人显此性，异人易察之而纠缠。吾尝为同砚妄告以“政客”，盖与闻放浪无名者之秘辛罢。

>privy to 秘密参与，了解

<br/>

Most of the confidences were unsought---frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon---for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. 而多非吾所求。每当……？？？，吾以假寐、心不在焉、轻佻？？？……不管了我先去睡觉了QAQ 太肝了这玩意儿

<br/>

Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. 

惜言，毋意，莫方人，是为圣。

<br/>

I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies if parceled out unequally at birth. 

虽继家尊所诫，承其傲，仍惧遗之：人之初，性本异，天道不公，是以为偏。

>parcel 包，裹好，打包
